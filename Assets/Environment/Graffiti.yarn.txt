It's some graffiti written on the wall.

It says "The password is: " and some Zanilandese.

<<if $Dictionary_is_in_inventory is false>>
    You wish you knew Zanilandese.
<<else>>
    Pulling out your dictionary reveals...

    It's the Zanilandese word for 'swordfish'.
    <<set $password_for_tsv_known to true>>
