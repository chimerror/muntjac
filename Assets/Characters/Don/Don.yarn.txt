    -> Hi, uh... you look cool
        "Thanks. You look delicious."
        Wow, you were feeling pretty low about your looks!
        At least you think that was about your looks...

    "How about we go someplace more private?" you ask.
    "Sounds great, skunk. But a couple of things." he says.
    "I need a little appetizer before the main course."
    "Something from the diner, perhaps."
    "And no offense, but you look like you can use some... 'lotion'."
    "Lotion?" you ask.
    "I think the store has some." he replies.
    "It'll make this all go down easier, trust me, skunk."
    "OK, I'll get right on that!" you say.
    "Radical."
