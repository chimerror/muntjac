"What can I get you?" Ron says bluntly.
<<if visited("DonCloseup.MakeMove") is false>>
    Oh no! There's too many options!
    Maybe you can decide on one later.
<<else>>
    Your eyes immediately land on the Don's Special.
    He must come here a lot!
    <<if $GiftCard1_is_in_inventory is false>>
        "You don't have enough money." Ron says.
        "Maybe you can find one of our gift cards."
    <<else>>
        You pass over the gift card.
        "Pleasure doing business with you."
        "Looks like that card is empty now."
        <<removeFromInventory GiftCard1>>
        <<placeInInventory Appetizer>>
    <<endif>>
